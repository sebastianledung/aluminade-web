		<div id="rules">
  			<span class="rules-h2">- Criminal slandering and threats are strictly prohibited in Leninspeak.</span>
  			Criminal slandering is the insinuation about criminal activity 
			related to an individual, whereas proof of criminal activity or behavior
			does not exist and can not be proven.
  			Threats are a spoken intent to harm a, in Leninspeak, connected 
			individual. Threats do not only take form in the spoken intent to 
			physically harm someone,
			but can also be the spoken intent to economically or psycologically 
			harm someone.<br><br>
  			
			<span class="rules-h2">- Spam is prohibited in Leninspeak due to the 
			potential it has to annoy someone who is in-game and thereby throw them 
			off their momentum.</span>
  			Spam is, but is not limited to, excessive poking without important 
			content or substance, chat-spam and complain-spam targeted against one 
			specific person.<br><br>
  			
  			<span class="rules-h2">- Harassment is also strictly prohibited in 
			Leninspeak due to the fact that Leninspeak is supposed to serve as a 
			meeting ground where anyone should feel welcome.</span>
			Harassments are, but are not limited to, repeated negative behavior 
			and negative comments, targeted at a specific individual connected to 
			Leninspeak, excluding a specific individual 
			and negative rumor spreading (not criminal slandering) targeted at a 
			specific individual. For more information about harassment, see rule 4.<br><br>
  			
  			<span class="rules-h2">- Racism, homophobic and/or sexist behavior will not be accepted in Leninspeak.</span>
			Note that racism, homophobia and sexism is a thought through and 
			systematic oppression and diminution of people who do not share the same
			skincolor, sex or sexuality as the perpetrator.
			This rule includes slanderous words like, but are not limited to 
			words such as, “nigger”, “faggot” och “whore”.<br><br>
  			
  			<span class="rules-h2">- Generic or misleading names are prohibited in Leninspeak.</span>
			Connecting to Leninspeak with the name of a staffmember or connecting
			to Leninspeak with a randomized or generic name is thereby punishable.<br><br>
  			
  			<span class="rules-h2">- All attempts to avoid getting punished by the staff of Leninspeak or the punishment itself is a serious offence on Leninspeak.</span>
			Therefore it is punishable to, for example, connect to Leninspeak 
			from another computer or smartphone during a ban or to leave the server 
			before
			a staff member has a chance to punish you for an offence you’ve 
			committed.<br><br>
			
  			<span class="rules-h2">- Any abuse of the server is strictly prohibited.</span>
			Examples of this are, but are not limited to, changing any server 
			settings, changing any group hierarchys or attempting to DoS the server 
			is therefore punishable.<br><br>
			
			<span class="rules-h2">- Hacking and abusing cheats within a game is not allowed.</span>
			If you get caught using cheats or hacks that gives you an unfair 
			advantage against
			your opponents you'll risk getting a ban from our teamspeak. This ban
			ranges from 6 months to a permanent ban from our teamspeak.<br><br>
			<u>You're not only ruining the game for your opponents but also your teammates.</u><br><br>

  		Furthermore Leninspeak has a few guidelines which are to be followed
 to the best of your ability.
		First and foremost, the server is everyone’s responsibility. Thereby 
are you, as “Trusted” or of a higher hierarchical position obliged to, 
not only be careful about who you invite, but also keep an eye on these 
for as long as they are connected to Leninspeak (as long as they do not 
themselves do not carry the rank of “Trusted” or higher). If you would 
like to use Leninspeak for a 5 v. 5, a raid or any other group activity 
where many, if not a majority, of those connected are of a non-existing 
hierarchical position, you are obliged to keep an eye on the people 
connected and you are also obliged to ask a staff member in advance if 
the group activity can be facilitated on the server. <br><br>

		The staff of Leninspeak insist on the right on doing decisons related 
to those connected to Leninspeak within the boundries of the rules. 
Moderators and other staffmembers thereby have the right to make a 
decision on whether or not someone should be punished for an offence 
with a warning, a kick or a ban and always have the final say.
