		Ah, the questions of this universe, alluring and incredibly complicated.<br>
		Some things are alluring and not complicated at all however, like joining the Aluminade community. <br><br>
		We are a gaming community based in Sweden but with players and members across Europe.<br>
		We are not only a group of people to come to when you want to play games, we are a community of members who share
		the same mantra and strive,<br> 
		not only to be the best, but also to be the funniest, most offensive and likeable pieces of human scum on this planet.<br><br>
		We are by no means elitist, and your personality is always valued as more important to us than your performances ingame.<br>
		That basically means that you getting a 40 bomb in MM is all cool and 
well, but you acting like an asshole the whole way to that 40 bomb 
pretty much<br>
		makes you have to take a premature exodus from our community.<br><br>
		
		Now you might be asking: “Well, this all sounds great, but how do i become a member of Aluminade?<br>
		Where is the application? What do i need to know to become a part of this?”
		Let me answer that question for you little Timmy.<br>
		First of all your personality needs to click with ours. You obviously 
can't be friends with everyone, but having mutual respect,
		even for the people whom you dislike<br> 
		is incredibly important, not only for us as a community but also to keep the morale of everyone in the community up!<br><br>

		There are no applications for Aluminade, it’s a question of how well 
the chemistry is not only on teamspeak, but also ingame and how we 
function together in a stressful situation. <br>What you need to know about Aluminade is that it exists
		everywhere. In the deepest dungeons of Russia and in the iciest glaciers of the South Pole.<br>
		We exist in the government and in the homeless alcoholic on the corner
 of your street, that guy that always smells of urine and sleeps outside
 of
		the liquorstore at 4 in the<br> afternoon because he’s too fucked up 
on schnapps to keep awake.
		Aluminade started as a concept, became an idea, transcended into the 
realm of existence through teamspeak, grew as a community, ranked up on 
counterstrike and became top tier. What is next you wonder?<br> So do i, so do i.<br><br>

		Interested in joining? Talking shit? White knighting? Becoming a swordjuggling clown? Contact us right away!
		Aluminade never turns down a honest fight, as we always win on a spiritual<br>
 level anyways. Want to challenge us in any of the games we play? Get to
 the contact page right away dear contender and send us a message about 
the challenge you propose!
